<h1>Project's Technological Content</h1>
<p>The website's main technology that have been used is JavaScript. JavaScript is the core of the website as it is the reason behind the functionality of it. 
In order to make the website function as a full CRUD (create, read, update, and delete), it was linked and combined with MongoDB which allowed to store all data related to the combo
, including a username and a password for each user.
 </p>
<br>
<p>In addition, CSS has been implemented to design and make changes to the website. For example, one of the techiques that have been used is 
whenever the user hovers on any of the characters available, the character's background will be highlighted. Overall make the website look decently and related to fighting games by using background images of fighting games. </p>
<br>
<p>Moreover, HTML has been use to structure the web  page content. For example, include images of the character and the game to make it simple for the use to navigate in the 
website by using "a" tag. There is also forms which have label input areas which allow the user to type and upload a link of a video file of the desired combo. </p>

<h1>Improvements for The Future</h1>
<p>The website can be improved a lot from it's current state and here are some examples: 
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Add multiple games</li>
  <li>Include all characters for all games</li>
  <li>Filter base on combo specifications</li>
  <li>Allow the website work without signing up and only limit upload, delete, and update to those who have an account</li>
</ul>
